# HundredDayCodeSprint
I’m starting a 100-day coding challenge to improve my skills and build a habit of consistent practice. Each day, I’ll work on coding problems and personal projects to keep growing and pushing myself.

After a few tries that didn’t go as planned, I’m giving it another go by committing publicly this time to this challenge starting today.

## My Plan:
1. Code for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Document my learning and insights by logging daily updates here

## Flexibility Rules:
If I miss a day, I’ll get back on track the next day.
I might take occasional breaks if something urgent comes up.
