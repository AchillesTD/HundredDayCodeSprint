# HundredDayCodeSprint
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b14cbe0-a800-4493-82b9-dd18883812eb)
I’m starting a 100-day coding challenge to improve my skills and build a habit of consistent practice. Each day, I’ll work on coding problems and personal projects to keep growing and pushing myself.

After a few tries that didn’t go as planned, I’m giving it another go by committing publicly this time to this challenge starting today.

## My Plan:
1. Code for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Document my learning and insights by logging daily updates here

## Flexibility Rules:
If I miss a day, I’ll get back on track the next day.
I might take occasional breaks if something urgent comes up.

#100DaysOfCode

### Day 1 (04-09-2024)
- Solved 2-3 array questions
  - reversal of array with the swapping method (previously used to declare new array for the same which used to have greater space complexity).
  - returning the index of the unique element from a sorted array and if not found then place that element in the array and return the newly formed array.
  - [Find Unique](https://www.naukri.com/code360/problems/find-unique_625159)
>[!NOTE]
_Its not like i didn't know how to reverse an array by just swapping but its just that my brain is always unknowingly attracted to brute force method instead. Its like my brain keeps whispering, “Let’s reinvent the wheel every time._

### Day 2 (05-09-2024)
- Had to take the day off due to prior commitments that occupied my entire day.

### Day 3 (06-09-2024)
- Solved 2 questions and worked on my gstreamer project mostly
  - Solved a question that my workplace colleague suggested where I had to return the index of an element (int) from a sorted array and if that element doesnt exists then I have to add that element in the array such that the new array is sorted as well and then finally return the index from the newly created/sorted array. (was a fun question except for the part where i used linear search instead of binary)

### Day 4 (07-09-2024)
- BDay off :)

### Day 5 (08-09-2024)
- Solved few array questions again and revised OOPS concepts (Inheritence only)
  - [1207.Unique number of occurrences](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/)
  - [Duplicate In Array](https://www.naukri.com/code360/problems/duplicate-in-array_893397)
  - [Intersection Of Two Sorted Arrays](https://www.naukri.com/code360/problems/intersection-of-2-arrays_1082149)

### Day 6 (09-09-2024)
- Read and tinkered around with OOPs contructors


### Day 7 (10-09-2024)
- worked with gstreamer trying to get rtsp to web and couldn't find myself time to do anything else

### Day 8 (11-09-2024)
- Solved some puzzles
  - Puzzles solved - [puzzle-2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-2-find-ages-of-daughters/), [puzzle-3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-3-calculate-total-distance-travelled-by-bee/), [puzzle-1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-1-how-to-measure-45-minutes-using-two-identical-wires/?ref=lbp), [puzzle-6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-6-monty-hall-problem/?ref=lbp), [puzzle-6x6-grid-how-many-ways](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-6x6-grid-how-many-ways/)
  
>[!NOTE]
_I'll have to admit that if I had gotten [puzzle-2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-2-find-ages-of-daughters/) puzzle to solve in an interview and it's my first time coming across it then I wouldn't have been able to solve it in my first try as the approach was completely alien to me. Also, [this](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-monty-hall-problem/) provides a better understanding of Monty Hall_

### Day 9 (12-09-2024)
- Read and practiced some use cases of Inheritence
- Solved a question where you had to return true/false depending on the input string like if its in the right format then return true (HELLO, Hello, hello) and return false if some incorrect format string is there like (HeLlo, heLLo). (solved this using python but couldn't solve the same using cpp....so i need to work with string manipulation)

### Day 10 (13-09-2024)
- Solved various versions of Monty hall and gold bar puzzles.
- find the largest and second largest number in an unsorted array

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due to my bad health condition, I couldn't do any practical implementation during the weekend, so I'm not sure if I should count those days. For now, I’m not counting them. Sorry.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Solved a really nice [elevator puzzle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-elevator-puzzle/?ref=ml_lbp) today which made me realize just how much I’ve been ignoring my gut instinct. I always jump into the technical stuff pov with puzzles, but I really need to pay more attention to the big picture.**
